so in my project I mainly used Javascript and css to create my ai chat bot 
I hope you see the code in detail 
and also you can see my other projects I pushed here I github

sum chatbot
before running the code we install some packages in your terminal by using  npx-react-app
and then after it will install the modules
after that run cd <your file name>
and then run npm start
after that you can copy the source code from here and paste it in your code and it will work.
